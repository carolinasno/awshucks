### AW SHUCKS

AW SHUCKS is an app that provides information on different types of oysters.

---

### Development Approach

AW SHUCKS was created to provide information on different types of oysters. Because there aren't any APIs or databases that show information specifically on oysters, a JSON file with a list of oysters and its details was created and imported into a Mongo database. Once that was complete, user register and login forms were added for users to create an account to access information on oysters. See Version 2 for more information on how user accounts will eventually be used.
